# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an educational repository demonstrating GPU kernel programming using Triton, OpenAI's GPU kernel language. It covers basic operators and advanced Flash Attention implementations.

## Running the Code

This is a notebook-based project. Run in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Requirements: PyTorch, Triton, NVIDIA CUDA GPU

## Structure

- `basic_operators/` - Introductory Triton examples (start here)
- `flash_attention/` - Flash Attention implementations and benchmarks
